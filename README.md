# Geometric-Deep-Learning
Graph Node Classification using PyTorch Geometric on the Amazon Computers dataset + Presentation slides

This project was developed in the context of the final project of the Computational Geometry course of the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications of NKUA 2020 by Soulounias Nikolaos and Iyamu Perisanidis Simon.

The Jupyter notebook is acompanied with a pdf that contatins the presentation slides. The goal of this presentation was to preview what geometric deep learning is and show a real world application as well as efficiency.
